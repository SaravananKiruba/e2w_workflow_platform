## 🏗️ CURRENT ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY


---

## 🏗️ CURRENT ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

### ✅ **What's Built & Working**

**Multi-Tenant Foundation**
- ✅ Complete tenant isolation via `tenantId` in all tables
- ✅ Middleware enforces tenant context on every request
- ✅ Row-level security via Prisma queries
- ✅ Tenant model with: branding, settings, subscription tier

**Dynamic Schema & Metadata**
- ✅ `ModuleConfiguration` table stores tenant-specific field definitions as JSON
- ✅ `DynamicRecord` table stores all module data as JSON (flexible schema)
- ✅ `MetadataLibrary` table defines available field types, UI components, validation types
- ✅ Field types supported: text, email, phone, number, currency, date, dropdown, checkbox, textarea, lookup, table, formula
- ✅ `ModuleConfigService` validates field definitions against metadata library

**Dynamic UI Rendering**
- ✅ `DynamicForm` component renders forms from tenant configuration
- ✅ `DynamicField` component handles all field types dynamically
- ✅ `TableField` component for line items (orders, invoices, quotations)
- ✅ Layout support: single-column, two-column, tabbed, wizard
- ✅ One generic `/modules/[moduleName]` page works for ALL modules

**Lead-to-Cash Pipeline**
- ✅ 6 core modules seeded: Leads, Clients, Quotations, Orders, Invoices, Payments
- ✅ Conversion workflows:
  - Lead → Client (status-based, field mapping)
  - Quotation → Order (data copy, auto-numbering)
  - Order → Invoice (data copy, date calculations)
  - Payment → Invoice (linking, status update)
- ✅ Auto-numbering service: QT-001, ORD-001, INV-001, TXN-001
- ✅ Lookup fields link records between modules
- ✅ Cascade population auto-fills related fields

**Audit & Compliance**
- ✅ Complete audit logging: who changed what, when
- ✅ Tracks: user, timestamp, before/after changes, IP address, user agent
- ✅ Audit logs for: config changes, data mutations, conversions

**Workflow Engine (Backend)**
- ✅ Workflow engine architecture: triggers, conditions, actions
- ✅ Database models: `Workflow`, `WorkflowExecution`
- ✅ Condition evaluation: AND/OR logic, field comparisons
- ✅ Actions: sendEmail, updateRecord, createRecord, notification, webhook
- ⚠️ No UI builder yet - workflows configured via JSON

**Analytics Engine (Backend)**
- ✅ Analytics calculations: revenue, order counts, payment rates, AOV
- ✅ Methods exist in `AnalyticsEngine.ts`
- ⚠️ No dashboard UI yet

**Governance (Backend)**
- ✅ Three-tier workflow: draft → review → active
- ✅ API endpoints: submit for review, approve/reject configs
- ✅ Versioning system for configuration changes
- ⚠️ No SaaS provider UI yet

### 🔴 **Critical Gaps**

1. **No GST/Tax Calculations** - Required for Indian compliance
2. **No PDF Generation** - Can't send professional quotations/invoices
3. **No Email Service** - Manual email delivery only
4. **No Visual Workflow Builder** - Workflows are code-based JSON
5. **No Analytics Dashboard** - Metrics calculated but not displayed
6. **No Visual Field Configurator** - Limited admin UI for field management
7. **No Tests** - No unit, integration, or E2E tests
8. **No Production Deployment Setup** - No Docker, env configs, CI/CD
